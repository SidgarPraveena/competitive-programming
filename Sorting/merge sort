Merge sort sorts a subarray array[a...b] as follows:

1. If a = b, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.
2. Calculate the position of the middle element: k = b(a+ b)/2c.
3. Recursively sort the subarray array[a...k].
4. Recursively sort the subarray array[k +1...b].
5. Merge the sorted subarrays array[a...k] and array[k +1...b] into a sorted subarray array[a...b].

Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it halves the size of the subarray at each step. 
The recursion consists of O(logn) levels, and processing each level takes O(n) time. Merging the subarrays array[a...k] and array[k + 1...b] is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.
