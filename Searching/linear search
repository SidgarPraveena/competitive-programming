A general method for searching for an element in an array is to use a for loop that iterates through the elements of the array. 
For example, the following code searches for an element x in an array:
			for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
			{
				if (array[i] == x) 
				{
					// x found at index i
				}
			}

The time complexity of this approach is O(n).
