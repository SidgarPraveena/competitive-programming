A queue also provides two O(1) time operations: adding an element to the end
of the queue, and removing the first element in the queue. It is only possible to
access the first and last element of a queue.
The following code shows how a queue can be used:
			queue<int> q;
			q.push(3);
			q.push(2);
			q.push(5);
			cout << q.front(); // 3
			q.pop();
			cout << q.front(); // 2
