A deque is a dynamic array whose size can be efficiently changed at both ends of the array. 
Like a vector, a deque provides the functions push_back and pop_back, but it also includes the functions push_front and pop_front which are not available in a vector.
A deque can be used as follows:
			deque<int> d;
			d.push_back(5); // [5]
			d.push_back(2); // [5,2]
			d.push_front(3); // [3,5,2]
			d.pop_back(); // [3,5]
			d.pop_front(); // [5]

The internal implementation of a deque is more complex than that of a vector, and for this reason, a deque is slower than a vector. Still, both adding and removing elements take O(1) time on average at both ends.
