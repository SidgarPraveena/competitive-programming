A stack is a data structure that provides two O(1) time operations: 
1) adding an element to the top, 
2) removing an element from the top. 
It is only possible to access the top element of a stack.
The following code shows how a stack can be used:
			stack<int> s;
			s.push(3);
			s.push(2);
			s.push(5);
			cout << s.top(); // 5
			s.pop();
			cout << s.top(); // 2
